<p>’During the fall 2019 semester we had the opportunity to work with R studio and Python. Using R studio we completed two projects using various different data dets. Using python we were able to create functions to analyze DNA and amino acid sequences.</p>
<p>Example) I was able to create a function that can take a DNA sequence and break up into 3-mers. A function was also used to count the number of 3-mers created by the previous function.</p>
<p>The function sequences used were:</p>
<p>my_seq1 = “ATCATCATG”
my_seq2 = “CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT”</p>
<p>The Python functions were:</p>
<p>[In] def kmer_count(seq, k): f = {}
for x in range(len(seq)+1-k): kmer = seq[x:x+k]
f[kmer] = f.get(kmer, 0) + 1
return(f)
kmer_count(my_seq1,3)
kmer_count(my_seq2,3)</p>
<p>The output of the second function can be seen in the image below:</p>
