      <description>â€™During the fall 2019 semester we had the opportunity to work with R studio and Python. Using R studio we completed two projects using various different data dets. Using python we were able to create functions to analyze DNA and amino acid sequences.
Example) I was able to create a function that can take a DNA sequence and break up into 3-mers. A function was also used to count the number of 3-mers created by the previous function.</description>
